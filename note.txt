Open a terminal and start the server
Print the PID

Open another terminal and compile the client
execute ./client and pass the PID along with the string

The server has to receive the string and display it asap

To comprehend the implementation of Minitalk, it is necessary to 
have a fundamental understanding of signals and sigaction, 
as well as the process of converting characters to binary and vice versa.

Signals are software interruptions that are utilized to interrupt a running process 
to execute another action. Examples include bus error and segfault.

If a signal is ignored, it means that the process has no response to the interruption, 
although it should be noted that certain signals cannot be ignored, such as SIGKILL and SIGSTOP.

----------------------------------------------

Signals are like integer notifications that tell you what to do
